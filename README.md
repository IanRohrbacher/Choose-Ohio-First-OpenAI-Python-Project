# COF OpenAI Python Project
This project was created for my 2024/25 Choose Ohio First (COF) scholarship. It adapts and extends the [Babagaboosh](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh) codebase to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-time, automated feedback and monitoring in coding education.


## Project Summary
This Python application demonstrates an AI-driven system for monitoring and supporting students in coding classrooms. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to analyze student code submissions, detect signs of struggle, and alert instructors for timely intervention. The system is designed for K-12 block-based coding tasks, but the approach is adaptable to other educational settings.

**Key Features:**
- Reads pre-formatted questions and code submissions from an input file (`input.txt`) generated by another app
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to evaluate student progress and flag struggles
- Automatically alerts instructors when intervention is needed
- Persists chat history for session continuity and retrospective review

> **Note:** This project is a proof-of-concept and is not actively maintained.


## How It Works
- The system runs a loop, waiting for a trigger (F4 key) to read a pre-formatted question and code submission from `input.txt` (generated by another app).
- The submission and question are sent to GPT-4o, which evaluates if the student is struggling based on prompt engineering and conversation history.
- If repeated mistakes or lack of progress are detected, the system flags the student for instructor intervention.
- All interactions are saved to a backup file for session recovery and teacher review.


## File Structure
- `chatgpt_character.py`: Main script for running the monitoring loop and handling user input.
- `openai_chat.py`: Handles OpenAI API calls and chat history management.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `input.txt`: File where student code submissions are read from.
- `ChatHistoryBackup.txt`: Stores chat history for session continuity.


## Setup
- Python 3.9.2 required ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/))
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set the following API key as a Windows environment variable:
	- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- OpenAI GPT-4o API access requires a $5 credit ([details](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4-gpt-4-turbo-gpt-4o-and-gpt-4o-mini))


## Usage
1. Use another app to generate a pre-formatted question and code submission in `input.txt`.
2. Run: `chatgpt_character.py`
3. Press `F4` to read and process the submission from `input.txt`.
4. The system will analyze the submission and update the backup file.
5. Repeat as needed for new submissions.
